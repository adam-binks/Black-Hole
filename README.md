# Black-Hole
A tiny Unity game inspired by Tom Scott https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMLE7a3faI4

Gameplay is done but there's no ingame tutorial yet. To play you'll need Unity installed. 

When the tutorial is added (if ever) I'll upload an .exe, .app and Linux build to http://jellyberg.itch.io

HOW TO PLAY

Black Hole is a game for two players.

Choose a colour and take it in turns to place your counters by clicking on empty tiles.
Each player has ten counters, carrying values of 1 to 10. However, there are twenty one tiles - meaning that at the end of the game, when all tiles have been placed, there is one empty tile remaining. This is the black hole.
When all tiles have been placed, the black hole sucks in all of its neighbouring counters and adds up all of your counter values, and all your opponent's counter values. The player with the LOWEST total wins!

If you're confused, just watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMLE7a3faI4

The game is surprisingly psychological and strategic. Have fun!
